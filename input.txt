I was hungry, so I drove to the store to pickup a rotisserie chicken. When I got there, they were out of chicken. Instead, I got a frozen pizza. I tried paying for it, but my card declined. Luckily, I found some cash in my pocket and was able to pay for it. I drove back home and cooked the pizza in the oven. It was pretty good, but not amazing.
