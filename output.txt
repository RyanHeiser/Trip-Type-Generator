This story appears to be an example of a "quest." The individual set out with a specific goal in mind, which was to purchase a rotisserie chicken from the store. Despite the unplanned obstacles encountered, such as the store being out of chicken and the credit card's decline, the person managed to accomplish a modified version of the original task by purchasing a frozen pizza instead. Evidence from the story, such as "I was hungry, so I drove to the store to pickup a rotisserie chicken," displays a clear goal from the beginning, hence solidifying the argument that it's a quest.
